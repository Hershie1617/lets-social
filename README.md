# Let's Social ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to *Let's Social* â€” a fun little project I made while learning frontend web dev. It's a playful landing page where you can "join the vibe" and feel like you're part of something chill, interactive, and a little quirky.

## ðŸš€ What is this?
Honestly? It's a simple site with a dark theme, some animations, an interactive button, and a mini Spotify vibe section â€” just to make it feel alive. Think of it as a digital invite to the social side of the internet ðŸ˜„

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I made this
I wanted to:
- Practice my frontend skills (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Create something fun and minimal
- Learn how to host on GitHub and push a full project

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript 

## ðŸ”¥ Features
- Smooth button animations  
- Clean responsive design  
- A hidden Spotify playlist tab to set the mood ðŸŽ¶  
- No clutter â€” just straight to the point
